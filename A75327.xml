            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving ſince the firſt beginning of this Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament obſerved the differences therein, both in their breeding &amp; continuance; the people holding themſelves grieved with illegall preſſures put upon them, both in the freedom of their Perſons, the propriety of their Goods, and the liberty of their Conſciences; and theſe wrought by particular men for ſiniſter ends by their intereſts in Court, to the diſturbance of the quiet and peace of the Kingdome, as it ſtood eſtabliſh'd by Law: Theſe occaſioned a deſire by moſt men, not only to prevent the like for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but alſo the puniſhing of ſuch as were conceived to be Authors, Procurers, or Supporters thereof, thereby to deterre others from doing the like hereafter. And this trench't upon both Courtiers, Lawyers, and Divines. The meanes to reconcile and prevent which, as the times now are, hath incited me, being a Member of this preſent Parliament; and conceiving my ſelf in duty bound to tender my beſt advice for the ſpeedy ending of this moſt barbarous and unnaturall War that is now raging amongſt us, which can produce no better effect, if not timely ended, then a generall deſtruction of the Nation, who are now become a Scorne and Contempt to all Neighbours, (who were before look't upon with great honour and reſpect, yea, not without envy.) Beſides, the high wrath of Almighty God, by the courſes held and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the proſecution thereof: I profeſſe by this advice, not to look upon my ſelf, but meerly the good of my native
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116655:3"/>Country; and that, which I conceive my ſelf bound to, both by the Oath of Allegeance, Supremacy, and the Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I took this Parliament. And this without reſpect of any party, futher then my judgement ſhall lead me to. And I ſhall likewiſe give this testimony of my own ſincerity herein, that I being a Commoner of this Kingdome, and knowing no where elſe to live but in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; here, under a peaceable and free Government. In all juſt things, ſhall adhere to the Common-wealth, and the liberties of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; yet no way hereby to detract from the King, what may juſtly be due to the Regall Power, and which it can no way be abridged of, whithout too much diminution: I have alwayes conceived, &amp; ſtill do, that the Regall Power ought to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Law; And if it be debarr'd of its due courſe in the execution thereof, God defend, but the people upon generall complaints ſhould have remedy therein, eſpecially to prevent the like in ſucceeding times, conſidering the Government we live in is a mixt Government, by conſent betweene the King and the People, as to my ſenſe doth manifeſtly appear by the words of the Oath of Coronation; which being obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the people, as bound in Conſcience, ought to yeild the King all due Honour and Obedience to His juſt Commands. Thus I have declared unto you, the openneſſe of my heart, herein leaving the following adviſe to your beſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with my Prayers to God, to give ſuch ſucceſſe therein, as I, in the Integrity of my heart doe deſire.</p>
